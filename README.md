## INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic reshaped social, economic, and health systems across the world, making it one of the most significant global events of the past decade. Because the impact of the virus varied widely between regions and over time, understanding how cases and deaths evolved has been essential for governments, health organizations, and the public. For this project, we chose the Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset because it provides one of the most complete and widely used public records of pandemic statistics, covering more than 200 countries with daily updates on cases, deaths, testing, vaccination, and population metrics. However, for our project, we'll focus on the cases and deaths variables.

## DATA
- The data comes from the COVID-19 Dataset on Kaggle, originally compiled from Our World in Data.
- OWID is a widely trusted public source that aggregates global COVID-19 statistics from official government and health agency reports.
- Includes COVID-19 data for over 200 countries and territories.
- Contains 67 distinct variables.
- Provides daily data from early 2020 through 2022.

## RESEARCH QUESTIONS
### Main research question.

- How does the relationship between COVID-19 cases and deaths vary across countries and over time?

Examining this relationship is important because cases alone do not fully describe the severity of the pandemic. Countries with similar case numbers often experienced very different mortality outcomes due to differences in health-care capacity, population size, vaccination rates, etc. By comparing these patterns at multiple geographic scales, we are able to highlight where outbreaks were most severe, when mortality risk increased, and how these patterns changed throughout the pandemic.

That is why our dashboard includes a set of visualizations, each designed to answer a specific question of interest, helping us interpret different aspects of the pandemic. We will outline each of these questions as we look at each graph.

### Specific questions of interest. 

1. How did monthly COVID-19 cases or deaths evolve across continents from 2020–2022, and which regions experienced the highest outbreaks?
2. How were COVID-19 cases or deaths distributed geographically each month, and which countries showed the highest burden relative to population size?
3. Which countries had the highest COVID-19 burden in a given month, and how do their new cases, new deaths, and cumulative totals compare
4. Within a selected continent, which countries experienced the highest overall COVID-19 deaths or cases, and how large are the gaps between them?
5. For a selected country, how strongly are new COVID-19 cases associated with new deaths over time, and does this relationship change during different outbreak periods?
